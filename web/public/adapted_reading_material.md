# Copper Prices Expected to Decline in 2026 but Remain Strong Long-Term

Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that copper prices will fall slightly in 2026, settling between $10,000 and $11,000 per metric ton. However, the institution also maintains a positive outlook for copper over the longer term due to persistent supply [constraints:Something that limits or restricts actions or progress]. These are combined with an ongoing surge in global demand related to the [electrification:The process of replacing systems that use fossil fuels with ones that use electricity] of industries and the expansion of [infrastructure:The basic systems and services, such as transport and power supplies, that a country or organization uses to work effectively].

The analysis points out that copper prices reached their highest levels ever in 2025. Multiple factors contributed to this situation. Firstly, market [fundamentals:The most important underlying facts or principles about something] remained extremely tight, mainly driven by geopolitical instability and frequent disruptions in the supply chain. Additionally, the [transition:The process of changing from one condition or situation to another] to renewable energy led to a steady rise in copper consumption, as copper is a key raw material for building green energy systems.

Looking ahead to 2026, Goldman Sachs researchers believe several market conditions will change. [Tariff:A tax imposed on imported or exported goods] tensions are expected to decrease, and supply chains should begin to stabilize. These developments are likely to prevent the extreme fluctuations in copper prices that were observed previously. Nevertheless, experts indicate that copper’s underlying importance shows no sign of weakening. As more countries pursue green energy strategies, the demand for copper wiring and other components is forecast to remain [robust:Strong and not likely to fail or weaken].

Despite this anticipated short-term [moderation:The process of becoming less extreme or intense] in prices, the long-term [prospects:The possibility or likelihood of some future event happening] for copper are considered strong. [Structural:Related to the way in which something is built or organized] demand is projected to stay high due to the global shift towards sustainable energy sources. Green technology, electric vehicle production, and widespread [electrification:The process of replacing systems that use fossil fuels with ones that use electricity] all require significant copper input, supporting price growth over the next decade.

Goldman Sachs analysts have warned, though, that without increased mining activity and broader recycling efforts, copper supplies could fall seriously short of demand by the late 2020s. The analysts expect substantial [deficits:The amount by which something, especially money or supply, is too small] unless the mining sector expands production aggressively and recycles copper more efficiently. Thus, policymakers and investors need to closely monitor developments in government [tariffs:A tax imposed on imported or exported goods] as well as the level of spending on [infrastructure:The basic systems and services, such as transport and power supplies, that a country or organization uses to work effectively], since these factors will have a major impact on copper prices.

Furthermore, the analysts identify copper as a vital [indicator:Something that shows what a situation is like or how it is changing] of global economic health. As a widely used industrial [commodity:A raw material or product that can be bought and sold], copper’s price is often seen as a signal of changing economic trends, especially during periods of sustainability [transition:The process of changing from one condition or situation to another]. The year 2026 is predicted to be particularly significant for the copper market, as players across the industry will focus on managing the balance between reliable supply and strong demand.

In summary, although copper prices are set to ease from their record highs in 2026, the overall outlook for the metal is favorable. The ongoing global commitment to [electrification:The process of replacing systems that use fossil fuels with ones that use electricity] and [infrastructure:The basic systems and services, such as transport and power supplies, that a country or organization uses to work effectively] development suggests that copper will play a critical role in the modern economy. As a result, all stakeholders, from governments to investors, should pay attention to shifts in both supply and demand to navigate the evolving market efficiently.
