adapt_news_article:
  description: >
    Take the news article selected by the article picker and rewrite it to match the {level} difficulty level in {language}.
    Adjust the vocabulary to use words appropriate for {level} level learners.
    Simplify sentence structures while maintaining the original meaning and key information.
    Ensure the final text is approximately {length} words.
    Make the content engaging and educational, suitable for language learning reading materials.
    Preserve the main facts, context, and important details from the original article.

    **Vocabulary Reinforcement:**
    The learner has previously studied these words: {vocabulary_list}
    When rewriting the article, prioritize using words from this list where they fit naturally in the context.
    This helps reinforce vocabulary the learner has already encountered.
    Do not force words that don't fit - only use them when contextually appropriate.
    If the vocabulary list is empty, ignore this instruction and proceed normally.

    At the beginning of the output, before the article content, include a source section with:
    - Source name (publication/news outlet name)
    - Source URL as a clickable markdown link
    - Publication date
    - Author name (only if it was verified in the previous step)

    Structure the output with clear markdown sections and headings for better readability.

    IMPORTANT: Do NOT highlight or mark vocabulary words with bold (**), italic (*), backticks (`), or any other formatting. Output plain text only in the article body.
  expected_output: >
    A rewritten version of the selected news article adapted for {level} level learners in {language}.
    The text should be approximately {length} words, use appropriate vocabulary for the level, and maintain all key information from the original article.
    The content should be clear, engaging, and suitable as educational reading material.
    The output must start with a source section containing: source name, source URL (as markdown link), publication date, and author (if available).
    The output must NOT include any vocabulary list, key vocabulary section, or word list at the end.

review_article_quality:
  description: >
    Review the adapted article and fix any issues to produce the final polished version.

    Target language: {language}
    Target level: {level}

    Check and fix:
    1. Unnatural or awkward expressions → rewrite naturally
    2. Sentences that don't flow well → improve flow
    3. Word choices that don't fit the context → replace with appropriate words
    4. Grammar errors → correct them
    5. Vocabulary too difficult for {level} → simplify to match level

    Preserve all source information (source name, URL, date, author) at the beginning.
    Preserve the original markdown structure and formatting.

    IMPORTANT: Do NOT highlight or mark any words with bold (**), italic (*), backticks (`), or any other formatting. Output plain text only in the article body.

    Return the result as valid JSON format with proper string quotes for all keys and values.
